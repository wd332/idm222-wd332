            <p class="creatives-intro"> Tackled an issue regarding college commuters and their disassociation with the
                college campus and other difficulties that come along with being a commuter. By utilizing the design
                process to generate solutions through physical and digital forms, an app was formed to help commuters
                connect, as well as to events customized to their available schedules and a locker where commuters can
                store their belongings. A lounge was also dedicated to commuters for relaxation, sleep, studying, and
                other necessities. </p>

                    <h3> Research </h3>
                    <p> Our goal in our research was to understand the depth of the challenges commuters face and the
                        different parties involved. We conducted surveys, interviews, stakeholder research, and user
                        personas to understand more on what people need. </p>
                    <p> We've categorized what we've learned from our research into 5 parts and the solutions for them.
                        From
                        there, we ideated solutions and decided to build an app that is connected to a locker with a
                        digital
                        pad, along with remodeling Drexel's commuter lounge. </p>

                    <h3> Iterations + Ideations </h3>
                    <p> The app includes class schedules, notes, students' forums, transportation' schedules as well as
                        Drexel's announcements and events. The digital pad in our smart locker can keep track of
                        everything
                        no matter where they go, home or on campus. </p>
                    <p> The lounge would have convenient features such as sleeping pods, kitchen products, mini lockers,
                        and
                        more spaces for doing homework and relaxing. </p>

                    <h3> Prototypes </h3>
                    <p> With cardboard cutouts, 3D modeling software, and Figma, we were able to create low-fidelity
                        prototypes to be tested further and improved upon. </p>
