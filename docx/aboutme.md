# About Me

Hello! How are you? I’m Wendy.

I am a second-year college student from Drexel University majoring in User Experience & Interaction Design (UXID). I was part of Drexel’s First Year Exploratory Studies program during my freshman year to diversify and explore different fields of studies, which led me to become a peer mentor to future freshmen during my second year in college.

My professional goals are to gain exposure in UXID through collaboration in projects, which will help me develop leadership skills and gain more experience in it. I also want to broaden my skill set so that I can have multiple options for my future.

Aside from being in school, I enjoy participating in events that can help with my growth and to experience new things, which I will showcase below.
