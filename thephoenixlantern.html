            <p class="creatives-intro"> Through combining the qualities of the mythical creature Phoenix and a lantern
                through research, analysis, ideation, and designing, a new product was born! A modern lantern taking on
                the features of the Phoenix helping to connect people all around the world through its creative word
                design and the assistance of an app. </p>

                    <h3> Research </h3>
                    <p> Through researching the historical and cultural importance of the Phoenix and a lantern using
                        online
                        resources and user research, I was able to empathize with them and understand how they see
                        things and
                        how others perceive them. </p>

                    <h3> Ideation </h3>
                    <p> Through mindmapping, I was able to find a similarity between them that they both have
                        "connection". The
                        Phoenix has stories told all over the world, across different religions and myths. Lanterns are
                        used by
                        people in the past to see through the dark, and have advanced through knowledge passed down
                        through
                        generations to become the light bulbs we have today. </p>
                    <p> "How might we create a lantern that somehow connects people together like the Phoenix did?" </p>

                    <h3> Design Solution </h3>
                    <p> The Phoenix lantern creates an opportunity for people to connect with others all around the
                        world
                        through the touch of their phone and the presence of their lantern. </p>
                    <p> It is multifunctional with key features being that it can: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> fly (covers more areas for light to reach and represents like the Phoenix flying) </li>
                        <li> receive/send inspirational quotes to light someone's day or for general conversations
                            (connecting
                            with others far away) </li>
                        <li> change colors depending on how far another person with this lantern is (Phoenix is known to
                            have
                            different colors). </li>
                    </ul>
