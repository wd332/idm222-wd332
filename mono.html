                Through playing a game surrounding the theme of monochromes, players will understand more on how color
                works on the human eyes and how to differentiate them well. <br>
                This was a one week project.

            <h3> My Role </h3>
            <p> In this 2-people team project, I created 3 of the mini games along with the interactions for them,
                determined fonts and color pallete, and error-checked everything to make sure they are consistent. </p>

                    <h3> Target Audience </h3>
                    <p> This game is intended to teach people on the basics of colors and monochromes through a playful,
                        interactive way. </p>
                    <p> Emily is a high school student who is getting started in her artistic journey, beginning with
                        the fundamentals of colors. </p>

                    <h3> Research </h3>
                    <p> My vision for this mini game is to create a fun and interactive game that also teaches a lesson
                        to the user. I got this idea from two coding games that I have tried called "Flexbox Froggy" and
                        "Grid Garden", which teaches people on how those css properties work through visual
                        interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p> My study has taught me that monochromes can is one color that is in a range of shades going from
                        light to dark. You can manipulate the shades through sizes and overlapps to create distance,
                        showing dimunition. <br>
                        In color theory, the way a color's shade may be perceived by the user can be through its
                        surroundings. A light color in a dark area may look very bright compared to it being
                        in a light area. </p>

                    <p> <u>Game #1:</u> <br>
                        I wanted to make the experience enjoyable for the user through an easter egg in the game. It
                        showed three balls and that if you click on the yellow ball, it will tell you that it's actually
                        the sun. Small, lively dialogues like this are also enjoyable to read with emoticons to create a
                        more fun experience. </p>

                    <p> <u>Game #2:</u> <br>
                        I wanted to show them what exactly is a monochrome by letting users interact with the shapes
                        getting them from lightest to darkest. I added words of "lightest" and "darkest"
                        with their associated colors to allow the users a visual sense of what is light and dark in case
                        they didn't know. </p>
                    <img src="images/game2.gif" alt="Game #2" width="426" height="240">
                    <p> <u>Game #3:</u> <br>
                        I wanted to show users the power of illusions that colors can create. Keeping
                        consistency of monochromatic colors, I chose a base color of blue, and the light and dark colors
                        of that. Through the interaction of clicking the squares, they can see how colors affect each
                        other and how they see things. </p>

                    <h3> Results &amp; Outcomes </h3>
                    <p> I learned that through understanding the basics of how components and variables work, I can
                        create simple yet fun interactions for users to enjoy. </p>
