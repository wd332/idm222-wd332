                <p> As part of a pre-seed startup initiative during my 10-week internship at Coded By:, our team was
                    tasked with researching, validating, and designing a digital product that addressed a significant
                    business problem with market potential.</p>
                <p>Our initial concept centered around an event collaboration platform for small business owners — a
                    space
                    where local brands could connect and co-host marketing events to expand reach and share audiences.
                </p>
                <p>After several weeks of development and mentor feedback, we were advised that our approach, while
                    well-designed, was too narrow to appeal to a broader user base or investor interest. In response, we
                    pivoted our product direction into a comprehensive marketing campaign builder MVP, enabling users to
                    create, manage, and track campaigns across multiple channels such as events, social media, and
                    email.</p>
                <p>This case study walks
                    through that process — from research and design to
                    adaptation and final delivery.</p>

            <h3> My Role </h3>
            <p> I was the UI/UX Designer in this 4-people project, with the others being a designer, PM, and devloper. I
                worked on research, wireframing, ideation,
                design, and interactions. </p>

                <div class="research">
                    <h3> Research </h3>
                    <p> Because this project was aimed at pre-seed readiness, we began researching on what kind of
                        problems are out there, and seeing if those problems are viable enough to be tackled. Our goal
                        was to ensure that the pain point we addressed was large enough to
                        justify early-stage funding.
                    </p>
                    <p> <u>Initial Goals:</u> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Research on problems to pinpoint what is causing it through articles, blogs, and utilizing
                            the 5 Why Method</li>
                        <li> Validate the problems back by creating statements and finding 5 or more articles to prove
                            it's real</li>
                        <li> Calculate potential earnings through potential users and solutions already in the market
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> The card sort exercise conducted showed that testers would like to see the reviews of the
                        products and additional items in the navigation to enhance the site.

                    <h3>Design &amp; Prototyping </h3>
                    <h4> 1st Wireframe </h4>
                    <p> Since this was a collaboration platform, there had to be a way for people to find each other. In
                        businesses, people would give each other business cards. I thought it would be great to
                        introduce new people to users in such a way. I also wanted to make it easy for users to view
                        information without a lot of distractions from the side, so my initial wireframe had the cards
                        in the middle with some embellishments on the side for visuals.</p>
                    <p> The problem with this is that there is still too much white space, so it wasn't feasible. </p>
                    <img src="images/rocket-wireframe1.png" alt="business profile wireframe" width="1280" height="1499">
                    <h4> 2nd Wireframe </h4>
                    <p> In my second wireframe, I attempted a grid layout to fill in those whitespace. However the
                        problem now is that information is overwhelming for the user to absorb and it feels very dead
                        with how static it feels. </p>
                    <img src="images/rocket-wireframe2.png" alt="business profile wireframe" width="1280" height="1499">
                    <h4> 3rd Wireframe </h4>
                    <p> In my third wireframe, I decided to shrink the card so that there's less information for the
                        user to see, but still enough to garner interest for them to click to view more information
                        about their potential business collaborators. There would also be a "Recommendations" at the top
                        that would complement the business the user has. </p>
                    <p> Even when things got smaller, it still felt dead and static. Furthermore, making it smaller
                        didn't change the fact it was still overwhelming. I decided to look at home Airnbnb did things
                        and big pictures helped balance things out. </p>
                    <img src="images/rocket-wireframe3.png" alt="business profile wireframe" width="1280" height="513">
                    <h4> 4th Wireframe </h4>
                    <p> I tried a new approach on things and decided to give more space on the top as a
                        breathing space, but also so there's a clear indication that this is the business page. I also
                        added a search bar for easier navigation in case the filters doesn't have exactly what the user
                        wants. </p>
                    <p> I expanded my small profile picture image from the small card into one that expands and takes up
                        the whole card. I also added an arrow so that things could continue on as a carousel.</p>
                    <p> Still, I wished it was more dynamic and had the focus I originally wanted from my first
                        wireframe. </p>
                    <img src="images/rocket-wireframe4.png" alt="business profile wireframe" width="1280" height="818">
                    <h4> 5th Wireframe </h4>
                    <p> To create that focus that I want, I played with microinteractions. The middle card would always
                        be larger than the other cards to create a hierarchy and allow users to focus on the middle one.
                        When users click on the arrow, it will create a fluid movement going from one card to the next,
                        expanding and shrinking. </p>
