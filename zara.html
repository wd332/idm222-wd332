                In this 6-month project, I tackled issues regarding shoppers' experience navigating through Zara's
                website as they are going
                through the user flow of the checkout process. Through creating prototypes, a more visually appealing
                layout with added reviews section was created while preserving core branding elements was created. </p>
            <h3> My Role </h3>
            <p> In this solo project, I did the research, wireframing, ideation, design, and interactions. </p>
            <div class="creative-specifics-layout">
                <div class="target">
                    <h3> Target Audience </h3>
                    <p> Zara's shoppers are between the ages 18-40, which mean they would be in the generations that are
                        already exposed to the digital world and have some experiences in technology. They are catered
                        towards those that are fashion conscious with medium to high income. </p>
                    <p> In the user persona of Christine, a college student majoring in Fashion Design, she experiences
                        <u>pain points</u> from stress in the eye from images being too big and prices not shown right
                        away.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="target-image">
                    <img srcset="images/user-persona.png 900w, images/user-persona-fixed.webp 800w"

                    <h3> Research </h3>
                    <p> My goal in this research was to understand the pain points through user persona, how people
                        group elements together through card sorting/sitemapping, and additional feedback from testers
                        that want to
                        be incorporated.
                    </p>
                    <p> <u>Initial Goals:</u> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Create a way to inform the pricing of something to the user without the need to go to a
                            different page </li>
                        <li> Shrink the images to fit the screen so that it won't overwhelm the user </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> The card sort exercise conducted showed that testers would like to see the reviews of the
                        products and additional items in the navigation to enhance the site.

                    <h3> Design &amp; Prototyping </h3>
                    <p> Focusing on users' pain points and simplifying their experience, I created prototypes that
                        include their requests of having visible pricing and a snippet review section that can give
                        users a quick glance on what it offers. </p>
                    <p> To fit more with Zara's image of being avant garde and also reducing stress for the users' eyes,
                        I changed their layout design to fit more in
                        the style of the parallax grid system. </p>
                    <p> There is also a reviews section added into the product details page to allow users to see more
                        of what others have to say. </p>
                    <p> Zara's checkout process was shrunken to one page compared to their original design that had
                        multiple pages, creating more work than necessary for the user. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Changed the layout in a way that fits more with Zara's image of being avant garde through
                            using a parallax grid system </li>
                        <li> Created a way to inform the pricing of the item in the same page </li>
                        <li> Shrunk images to fit the screen so that it won't overwhelm the user </li>
                        <li> Added a reviews section for users to see quickly as they are scrolling </li>
                        <li> Deleted some sections in the homepage that was unnecessary and added prices for some items
                            there </li>
